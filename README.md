# Z88 EPROM Card
128kB EPROM board for the Cambridge Z88, based on XavSnap's design.

This version has the correct pin spacing for the edge connector (courtesy of [Jim Conner](github.com/jimconner))

# Current Status
The only circuit change made was the replacment of the connector footprint, so the board should work as it sits, but I have not personally built and tested one so YMMV.
